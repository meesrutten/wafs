## Vanilla JS vs Libraries & Frameworks
For this project we are going to look at the benefits and cons when using a framework or library against a purely JS written app.

### What are Frameworks
A framework is a premade setup where there is usually a predefined style of writing code.

### What are Libraries
A library is a piece of code written to be used as a helper for your project. It saves time and effort for the developer.

### The advantages of using a Framework
Frameworks are built to solve problems. Usually for group projects.

Express.js, a popular Node.js framework is built to make routing and templating.

Vue is a JS framework, it works component based which makes you write DRY code.

### The cons of using a Framework
A framework tells you how to write your program. Which may limit your ability to code when certain features aren't available. This may lead to creative coding and cluttered code.

A frameworks needs to be maintained. If certain big changes are made you will have to learn these and (might) have to change previous projects to stay updated.

### The advantages of using a Library
Libraries offer developers premade code which can help during development.

Libraries vary from very small to very big.

Libraries often offer solutions to common problems.

You can manipulate the code in any way you wish

### The cons of using a Library
Using libraries will not make you learn how to solve some problems by yourself.

Libraries need to be maintained and can sometimes contain vulnerabilities.

### The advantages of using vanilla JS
It's simply better performance wise, since it's compiles down and that's it. No need for it to work in conjuction with a framework or library.

You write the code yourself which can lead to less time solving errors.

The understanding of vanilla JS leads to you understanding what happens in new frameworks and/or libraries

### The cons of using vanilla JS
It can be a lot of work and cost you a lot of time to write a whole app in vanilla JS.

## SPA'S
Single page web apps don't need a server to serve the pages. All the navigation gets done without the browsers needing to refresh.

### The advantages of SPA
SPA's are extremely quick, it just needs to download the files once and a lot of things can be cached.

SPA's can have the feeling of a native app.

### The cons of SPA
You are forced to have Javascript enabled, the page won't work otherwise

### Best practices
Work component based or write DRY functional programs
